<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi,I'm Yucheng Li, a year-3 master stduent advised by [**Yanan Wang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iFxl5vwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra) in Donghua University, Shanghai. As a member of [**NewSense Research Lab**](https://hci-newsense.org/), my research focuses on **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, creating **immersive** and **multi-sensory experiences**, with an emphasis on <span class="red-text">**Interaction Design**</span>, <span class="red-text">**User Experience**</span> and <span class="red-text">**Virtual reality**</span>. I am particularly interested in developing innovative ways to enhance sensory feedback, such as through *material driven design(MDD)* to create olfactory feedback in specific people or scanio, to bridge the gap between physical and digital environments. 

I aim to design intuitive interfaces that enable users to engage more naturally feedback in virtual environments. My work spans experimental <span class="red-text">hardware development</span>, <span class="red-text">user-centered design</span>, and evaluating multi-sensory interfaces to explore how digital interactivity can be both enriching and intuitive.

So far, I cultivated my interest in HCI more focous on olfactory interaction by exploring a range of topics. Gradually, I found they formed three aspects: (1) **Hardware-driven olfactory design** – developing natural scent-release mechanisms for embodied olfactory displays (IJHCI). (2) **Contextual olfactory feedback** – studying how scent stimuli alter experiences in diverse VR scenarios (CHI’25, IJHCI). (3) **Crossmodal perception and multisensory integration** – examining how visual, tactile, and olfactory cues interact to shape immersion and presence (CHI’25, DIS’25).

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
